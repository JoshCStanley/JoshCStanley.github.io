			 <h1>Fly Information</h1>
			 <h2>Royal Wulff</h2>
			 <img src="images/royal wulff history.png" alt="royal wulff dry fly">
			 <p><b>Type:</b> Dry fly. </p>

			 <p><b>When to fish:</b> This fly is effective in rivers and streams all year round. It can be fished as a single dry or used to to suspend a nymph.</p>

			 <p><b>History:</b> One of the most popular and well known dry fly patterns. This fly is classified as an attractor pattern which means it does not specifically imitate one kind of insect. First created around the 1920’s there is some debate about who actually designed this fly. Credit is usually given to Lee Wulff, a well known American fly fisherman. Yet at the same time L.Q Quackenbush was developing what is now called the Royal Coachman. Coachmen and Wulffs are extremely similar in design. Lee Wulff's other fly patterns. </p>

		<h2>Squirmy Worm</h2>
		<img src="images/squirmys history.png" alt="squirmy worms">
		<p><b>Type:</b> Nymph.</p>
		<p><b>When to fish:</b> This fly works best early or late in the season and is particularly effective in coloured or secondhand water.</p>
		<p><b>History:</b> The squirmy worm is easily one of the most controversial fly patterns ever. It blurs the line between fly and lure. Many anglers don’t like this fly because it is so different from traditional fly patterns. Made out of silicone this fly is quite similar to soft lures or soft plastics. These flies were deadly in competitions and anglers began to simply push the material onto the hook the same way you might a soft plastic. This meant the flies were not being ‘tied’ and as a result all flies made from silicone were banned in FIPS Mouche (International Sport Fly Fishing Federation) competitions. Regardless of what people think of squirmy worms they are still extremely effective all around the world.</p>

			 <h2>Hotspot Pheasant Tail Nymph</h2>
			 <img src="images/PTN history.png" alt="pheasant tail nymph">
			 <p><b>Type:</b> Nymph</p>
			 <p><b>When to fish:</b> Effective in rivers all season. It can be fished under an indicator or with a euro nymphing setup </p>
		     <p><b>History:</b> The pheasant tail nymph was first tied by Frank Sawyer in 1958 at a time when nymph fishing was virtually unheard of. Frank's flies were extremely effective and quickly became popular around the world. Nowadays there are thousands of different variations. This hotspot pheasant tail is tied with a subtle copper bead and slim body to get the fly to depth quickly. A bright orange hotspot provides a trigger and point of difference from natural nymphs.</p>

			 <h2>CDC caddis</h2>
			 <img src="images/CDC caddis history.png" alt ="CDC caddis">
			 <p><b>Type:</b> Dry fly.</p>
			 <p><b>When to fish:</b> Works well during the warmer months when fish are looking up and rising. </p>
			 <p><b>History:</b> Use of CDC (Cul de Canard) in flies began in central europe around the 1920’s but only became popular in the 1980’s. CDC feathers are particularly buoyant due to small barbules on the feathers trapping pockets of air. This particular pattern has an orange sighter to make the fly easier to see. No hackle means that hooksets are much more likely to stick as there is nothing in the way of the hook. This fly casts well and can support small beaded nymphs.</p>

			 <h2> X Stimulator</h2>
			 <img src="images/x stimi 2.4.png" alt=" X stimulator dry fly">
			 <p><b>Type:</b> Dry fly.</p>
			 <p><b>When to fish:</b> A great attractor pattern that works well in warmer months. It can represent caddis, stonefly and terrestrials.</p>
			 <p><b>History:</b> Stimulators are believed to be a variation of stonefly imitations like the Sofa Pillow from the 1940’s and the Yellow-bellied Mattress Thrasher from the 1970’s. However Jim Slattery claims to have been the first to tie the fly in 1980. Regardless of its origin this is an effective fly when there is no obvious insect activity and can comfortably support beaded nymphs.</p>

			 <h2>Other Flies</h2>
			 <p><b>F-Fly</b></p>
			 <p>A small CDC dry fly that represents mayfly, caddis and other small insects. It is good for picky fish that might have refused other flies.</p>
			 <p><b>Perdigon</b></p>
			 <p>A small nymph with a slim body that allows it to get to depth quickly. Fishes well under an indicator or euro nymphed.</p>
			 <p><b>Tag Nymph</b></p>
			 <p>A bright hotspot to attract fish and a CDC hackle to make the fly appear more natural underwater. Fishes well under an indicator or euro nymphed. </p>
			 <p><b>Plume Tip</b></p>
			 <p>A small CDC dry that represents mayfly and other small insects. It works well in pools and flat water.</p>
			 <p><b>Hare and Partridge</b></p>
			 <p>A well known nymph that can represent a whole range of insects. It works particularly well early and late in the season but is still effective all year round.</p>
